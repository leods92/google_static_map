# google\_static\_map
A ruby interface to generate Google Maps static images.
Google Maps Image APIs are pretty straightforward and this gem makes using them even easier.


## Warning:
These are some of the first pieces of code I wrote in Ruby.
It works but it's limited to the uses I need in my own projects.

I might support this or not, use it at your own risk.


## Instalation instructions
